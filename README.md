# Focus Garden

Focus Garden is a digital wellbeing application designed to help you reduce screen time and improve focus.

## How it works:
1. **Focus Sessions**: Start a focus session when you want to put your phone down.
2. **Stay Present**: Keep the application open. If you switch to another app, the timer pauses and your progress for that session is calculated.
3. **Earn Hours**: For every hour spent focusing, you earn 1 "Hour" point.
4. **Grow Your Garden**: Use your earned Hours to purchase unique virtual plants (3 Hours each).
5. **Streaks**: Meet your daily goal of 3 focus hours for 2+ consecutive days to build a streak.
6. **Rewards**: Once you've grown 20 plants, you unlock exclusive discounts for food and beverage partners.
